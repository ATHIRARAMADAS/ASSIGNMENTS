<h1>WEB HOSTING</h1>
<P>History
Until 1991, the Internet was restricted to use only ...
for research and education in the sciences and engineering...
 and was used for email, telnet, FTP and USENET traffic - but only a 
 tiny number of web pages. The World Wide Web protocols had only just been written
 and not until the end of 1993 would there be a graphical web browser for Mac or Windows computers.
 Even after there was some opening up of internet access, the situation was confused until 1995.
To host a website on the internet, an individual or company would need their own computer or server.
 As not all companies had the budget or expertise to do this, web hosting services began to offer to 
 host users websites on their own servers, without the client without needing to own the necessary 
 infrastructure required to operate the website. The owners of the websites, also called webmasters 
 would be able to create a website that would be hosted on the web hosting service's server and published 
 to the web by the web hosting service.
As the number of users on the World Wide Web grew, 
the pressure for companies, both large and small to have an online presence grew. 
By 1995, companies such as GeoCities, Angelfire and Tripod were offering free hosting.
