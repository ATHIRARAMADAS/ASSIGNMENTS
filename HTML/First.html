<h1>WEB HOSTING</h1>
<P>A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service
 that allows individuals and organizations to make their website 
 accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that 
 provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, 
 as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data

 to the Internet for other servers located in their data center, called colocation,
 also known as Housing in Latin America or France.</P>
